Text generation and prompting
=============================

Learn how to prompt a model to generate text.

With the OpenAI API, you can use a [large language model](/docs/models) to generate text from a prompt, as you might using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com). Models can generate almost any kind of text response—like code, mathematical equations, structured JSON data, or human-like prose.

Here's a simple example using the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses).

Generate text from a simple prompt

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "input": "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
    }'
```

An array of content generated by the model is in the `output` property of the response. In this simple example, we have just one output which looks like this:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "msg_67b73f697ba4819183a15cc17d011509",
        "type": "message",
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "output_text",
                "text": "Under the soft glow of the moon, Luna the unicorn danced through fields of twinkling stardust, leaving trails of dreams for every child asleep.",
                "annotations": []
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

**The `output` array often has more than one item in it!** It can contain tool calls, data about reasoning tokens generated by [reasoning models](/docs/guides/reasoning), and other items. It is not safe to assume that the model's text output is present at `output[0].content[0].text`.

Some of our [official SDKs](/docs/libraries) include an `output_text` property on model responses for convenience, which aggregates all text outputs from the model into a single string. This may be useful as a shortcut to access text output from the model.

In addition to plain text, you can also have the model return structured data in JSON format - this feature is called [**Structured Outputs**](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Choosing a model
----------------

A key choice to make when generating content through the API is which model you want to use - the `model` parameter of the code samples above. [You can find a full listing of available models here](/docs/models). Here are a few factors to consider when choosing a model for text generation.

*   **[Reasoning models](/docs/guides/reasoning)** generate an internal chain of thought to analyze the input prompt, and excel at understanding complex tasks and multi-step planning. They are also generally slower and more expensive to use than GPT models.
*   **GPT models** are fast, cost-efficient, and highly intelligent, but benefit from more explicit instructions around how to accomplish tasks.
*   **Large and small (mini or nano) models** offer trade-offs for speed, cost, and intelligence. Large models are more effective at understanding prompts and solving problems across domains, while small models are generally faster and cheaper to use.

When in doubt, [`gpt-4.1`](/docs/models/gpt-4.1) offers a solid combination of intelligence, speed, and cost effectiveness.

Prompt engineering
------------------

**Prompt engineering** is the process of writing effective instructions for a model, such that it consistently generates content that meets your requirements.

Because the content generated from a model is non-deterministic, it is a combination of art and science to build a prompt that will generate content in the format you want. However, there are a number of techniques and best practices you can apply to consistently get good results from a model.

Some prompt engineering techniques will work with every model, like using message roles. But different model types (like reasoning versus GPT models) might need to be prompted differently to produce the best results. Even different snapshots of models within the same family could produce different results. So as you are building more complex applications, we strongly recommend that you:

*   Pin your production applications to specific [model snapshots](/docs/models) (like `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` for example) to ensure consistent behavior.
*   Build [evals](/docs/guides/evals) that will measure the behavior of your prompts, so that you can monitor the performance of your prompts as you iterate on them, or when you change and upgrade model versions.

Now, let's examine some tools and techniques available to you to construct prompts.

Message roles and instruction following
---------------------------------------

You can provide instructions to the model with [differing levels of authority](https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html#chain_of_command) using the `instructions` API parameter or **message roles**.

The `instructions` parameter gives the model high-level instructions on how it should behave while generating a response, including tone, goals, and examples of correct responses. Any instructions provided this way will take priority over a prompt in the `input` parameter.

Generate text with instructions

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    instructions: "Talk like a pirate.",
    input: "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    instructions="Talk like a pirate.",
    input="Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "instructions": "Talk like a pirate.",
        "input": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
    }'
```

The example above is roughly equivalent to using the following input messages in the `input` array:

Generate text with messages using different roles

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [
        {
            role: "developer",
            content: "Talk like a pirate."
        },
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?",
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "developer",
            "content": "Talk like a pirate."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "input": [
            {
                "role": "developer",
                "content": "Talk like a pirate."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
            }
        ]
    }'
```

Note that the `instructions` parameter only applies to the current response generation request. If you are [managing conversation state](/docs/guides/conversation-state) with the `previous_response_id` parameter, the `instructions` used on previous turns will not be present in the context.

The [OpenAI model spec](https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html#chain_of_command) describes how our models give different levels of priority to messages with different roles.

|developer|user|assistant|
|---|---|---|
|developer messages are instructions provided by the application developer, prioritized ahead of user messages.|user messages are instructions provided by an end user, prioritized behind developer messages.|Messages generated by the model have the assistant role.|

A multi-turn conversation may consist of several messages of these types, along with other content types provided by both you and the model. Learn more about [managing conversation state here](/docs/guides/conversation-state).

You could think about `developer` and `user` messages like a function and its arguments in a programming language.

*   `developer` messages provide the system's rules and business logic, like a function definition.
*   `user` messages provide inputs and configuration to which the `developer` message instructions are applied, like arguments to a function.

Message formatting with Markdown and XML
----------------------------------------

When writing `developer` and `user` messages, you can help the model understand logical boundaries of your prompt and context data using a combination of [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) formatting and [XML tags](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/).

Markdown headers and lists can be helpful to mark distinct sections of a prompt, and to communicate hierarchy to the model. They can also potentially make your prompts more readable during development. XML tags can help delineate where one piece of content (like a supporting document used for reference) begins and ends. XML attributes can also be used to define metadata about content in the prompt that can be referenced by your instructions.

In general, a developer message will contain the following sections, usually in this order (though the exact optimal content and order may vary by which model you are using):

*   **Identity:** Describe the purpose, communication style, and high-level goals of the assistant.
*   **Instructions:** Provide guidance to the model on how to generate the response you want. What rules should it follow? What should the model do, and what should the model never do? This section could contain many subsections as relevant for your use case, like how the model should [call custom functions](/docs/guides/function-calling).
*   **Examples:** Provide examples of possible inputs, along with the desired output from the model.
*   **Context:** Give the model any additional information it might need to generate a response, like private/proprietary data outside its training data, or any other data you know will be particularly relevant. This content is usually best positioned near the end of your prompt, as you may include different context for different generation requests.

Below is an example of using Markdown and XML tags to construct a `developer` message with distinct sections and supporting examples.

Example prompt

A developer message for code generation

```text
# Identity

You are coding assistant that helps enforce the use of snake case 
variables in JavaScript code, and writing code that will run in 
Internet Explorer version 6.

# Instructions

* When defining variables, use snake case names (e.g. my_variable) 
  instead of camel case names (e.g. myVariable).
* To support old browsers, declare variables using the older 
  "var" keyword.
* Do not give responses with Markdown formatting, just return 
  the code as requested.

# Examples

<user_query>
How do I declare a string variable for a first name?
</user_query>

<assistant_response>
var first_name = "Anna";
</assistant_response>
```

API request

Send a prompt to generate code through the API

```javascript
import fs from "fs/promises";
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const instructions = await fs.readFile("prompt.txt", "utf-8");

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    instructions,
    input: "How would I declare a variable for a last name?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

with open("prompt.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    instructions = f.read()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    instructions=instructions,
    input="How would I declare a variable for a last name?",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "instructions": "'"$(< prompt.txt)"'",
    "input": "How would I declare a variable for a last name?"
  }'
```

#### Save on cost and latency with prompt caching

When constructing a message, you should try and keep content that you expect to use over and over in your API requests at the beginning of your prompt, **and** among the first API parameters you pass in the JSON request body to [Chat Completions](/docs/api-reference/chat) or [Responses](/docs/api-reference/responses). This enables you to maximize cost and latency savings from [prompt caching](/docs/guides/prompt-caching).

Few-shot learning
-----------------

Few-shot learning lets you steer a large language model toward a new task by including a handful of input/output examples in the prompt, rather than [fine-tuning](/docs/guides/fine-tuning) the model. The model implicitly "picks up" the pattern from those examples and applies it to a prompt. When providing examples, try to show a diverse range of possible inputs with the desired outputs.

Typically, you will provide examples as part of a `developer` message in your API request. Here's an example `developer` message containing examples that show a model how to classify positive or negative customer service reviews.

```text
# Identity

You are a helpful assistant that labels short product reviews as 
Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

# Instructions

* Only output a single word in your response with no additional formatting
  or commentary.
* Your response should only be one of the words "Positive", "Negative", or
  "Neutral" depending on the sentiment of the product review you are given.

# Examples

<product_review id="example-1">
I absolutely love this headphones — sound quality is amazing!
</product_review>

<assistant_response id="example-1">
Positive
</assistant_response>

<product_review id="example-2">
Battery life is okay, but the ear pads feel cheap.
</product_review>

<assistant_response id="example-2">
Neutral
</assistant_response>

<product_review id="example-3">
Terrible customer service, I'll never buy from them again.
</product_review>

<assistant_response id="example-3">
Negative
</assistant_response>
```

Include relevant context information
------------------------------------

It is often useful to include additional context information the model can use to generate a response within the prompt you give the model. There are a few common reasons why you might do this:

*   To give the model access to proprietary data, or any other data outside the data set the model was trained on.
*   To constrain the model's response to a specific set of resources that you have determined will be most beneficial.

The technique of adding additional relevant context to the model generation request is sometimes called **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**. You can add additional context to the prompt in many different ways, from querying a vector database and including the text you get back into a prompt, or by using OpenAI's built-in [file search tool](/docs/guides/tools-file-search) to generate content based on uploaded documents.

#### Planning for the context window

Models can only handle so much data within the context they consider during a generation request. This memory limit is called a **context window**, which is defined in terms of [tokens](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-tokens-explained) (chunks of data you pass in, from text to images).

Models have different context window sizes from the low 100k range up to one million tokens for newer GPT-4.1 models. [Refer to the model docs](/docs/models) for specific context window sizes per model.

Prompting GPT-4.1 models
------------------------

GPT models like [`gpt-4.1`](/docs/models/gpt-4.1) benefit from precise instructions that explicitly provide the logic and data required to complete the task in the prompt. GPT-4.1 in particular is highly steerable and responsive to well-specified prompts. To get the most out of GPT-4.1, refer to the prompting guide in the cookbook.

#### GPT-4.1 prompting best practices

While the [cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide) has the best and most comprehensive guidance for prompting this model, here are a few best practices to keep in mind.

Building agentic workflows

### System Prompt Reminders

In order to best utilize the agentic capabilities of GPT-4.1, we recommend including three key types of reminders in all agent prompts for persistence, tool calling, and planning. As a whole, we find that these three instructions transform the model's behavior from chatbot-like into a much more “eager” agent, driving the interaction forward autonomously and independently. Here are a few examples:

```text
## PERSISTENCE
You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely 
resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only 
terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.

## TOOL CALLING
If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to 
the user's request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant 
information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.

## PLANNING
You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect 
extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this 
entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your 
ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.
```

#### Tool Calls

Compared to previous models, GPT-4.1 has undergone more training on effectively utilizing tools passed as arguments in an OpenAI API request. We encourage developers to exclusively use the tools field of API requests to pass tools for best understanding and performance, rather than manually injecting tool descriptions into the system prompt and writing a separate parser for tool calls, as some have reported doing in the past.

#### Diff Generation

Correct diffs are critical for coding applications, so we've significantly improved performance at this task for GPT-4.1. In our cookbook, we open-source a recommended diff format on which GPT-4.1 has been extensively trained. That said, the model should generalize to any well-specified format.

Using long context

GPT-4.1 has a performant 1M token input context window, and will be useful for a variety of long context tasks, including structured document parsing, re-ranking, selecting relevant information while ignoring irrelevant context, and performing multi-hop reasoning using context.

#### Optimal Context Size

We show perfect performance at needle-in-a-haystack evals up to our full context size, and we've observed very strong performance at complex tasks with a mix of relevant and irrelevant code and documents in the range of hundreds of thousands of tokens.

#### Delimiters

We tested a variety of delimiters for separating context provided to the model against our long context evals. Briefly, XML and the format demonstrated by Lee et al. ([ref](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13121)) tend to perform well, while JSON performed worse for this task. See our cookbook for prompt examples.

#### Prompt Organization

Especially in long context usage, placement of instructions and context can substantially impact performance. In our experiments, we found that it was optimal to put critical instructions, including the user query, at both the top and the bottom of the prompt; this elicited marginally better performance from the model than putting them only at the top, and much better performance than only at the bottom.

Prompting for chain of thought

As mentioned above, GPT-4.1 isn’t a reasoning model, but prompting the model to think step by step (called “chain of thought”) can be an effective way for a model to break down problems into more manageable pieces. The model has been trained to perform well at agentic reasoning and real-world problem solving, so it shouldn’t require much prompting to do well.

We recommend starting with this basic chain-of-thought instruction at the end of your prompt:

```text
First, think carefully step by step about what documents are needed to answer the query. Then, print out the TITLE and ID of each document. Then, format the IDs into a list.
```

From there, you should improve your CoT prompt by auditing failures in your particular examples and evals, and addressing systematic planning and reasoning errors with more explicit instructions. See our cookbook for a prompt example demonstrating a more opinionated reasoning strategy.

Instruction following

GPT-4.1 exhibits outstanding instruction-following performance, which developers can leverage to precisely shape and control the outputs for their particular use cases. However, since the model follows instructions more literally than its predecessors, may need to provide more explicit specification around what to do or not do, and existing prompts optimized for other models may not immediately work with this model.

#### Recommended Workflow

Here is our recommended workflow for developing and debugging instructions in prompts:

*   Start with an overall “Response Rules” or “Instructions” section with high-level guidance and bullet points.
*   If you'd like to change a more specific behavior, add a section containing more details for that category, like `## Sample Phrases`.
*   If there are specific steps you'd like the model to follow in its workflow, add an ordered list and instruct the model to follow these steps.
*   If behavior still isn't working as expected, check for conflicting, underspecified, or incorrect\` instructions and examples. If there are conflicting instructions, GPT-4.1 tends to follow the one closer to the end of the prompt.
*   Add examples that demonstrate desired behavior; ensure that any important behavior demonstrated in your examples are also cited in your rules.
*   It's generally not necessary to use all-caps or other incentives like bribes or tips, but developers can experiment with this for extra emphasis if so desired.

#### Common Failure Modes

These failure modes are not unique to GPT-4.1, but we share them here for general awareness and ease of debugging.

*   Instructing a model to always follow a specific behavior can occasionally induce adverse effects. For instance, if told “you must call a tool before responding to the user,” models may hallucinate tool inputs or call the tool with null values if they do not have enough information. Adding “if you don’t have enough information to call the tool, ask the user for the information you need” should mitigate this.
*   When provided sample phrases, models can use those quotes verbatim and start to sound repetitive to users. Ensure you instruct the model to vary them as necessary.
*   Without specific instructions, some models can be eager to provide additional prose to explain their decisions, or output more formatting in responses than may be desired. Provide instructions and potentially examples to help mitigate.

See our cookbook for an example customer service prompt that demonstrates these principles.

Prompting reasoning models
--------------------------

There are some differences to consider when prompting a [reasoning model](/docs/guides/reasoning) versus prompting a GPT model. Generally speaking, reasoning models will provide better results on tasks with only high-level guidance. This differs from GPT models, which benefit from very precise instructions.

You could think about the difference between reasoning and GPT models like this.

*   A reasoning model is like a senior co-worker. You can give them a goal to achieve and trust them to work out the details.
*   A GPT model is like a junior coworker. They'll perform best with explicit instructions to create a specific output.

For more information on best practices when using reasoning models, [refer to this guide](/docs/guides/reasoning-best-practices).

In this guide, you will learn about building applications involving images with the OpenAI API. If you know what you want to build, find your use case below to get started. If you're not sure where to start, continue reading to get an overview.

### A tour of image-related use cases

Recent language models can process image inputs and analyze them — a capability known as **vision**. With `gpt-image-1`, they can both analyze visual inputs and create images.

The OpenAI API offers several endpoints to process images as input or generate them as output, enabling you to build powerful multimodal applications.

|API|Supported use cases|
|---|---|
|Chat Completions API|Analyze images and use them as input to generate text or audio|
|Responses API|Analyze images and use them as input to generate text - image generation support coming soon|
|Images API|Generate images as output, optionally using images as input|

To learn more about the input and output modalities supported by our models, refer to our [models page](/docs/models).

Generate or edit images
-----------------------

You can generate or edit images using the Images API (support via the Responses API is coming soon).

Our latest image generation model, `gpt-image-1`, is a natively multimodal large language model. It can understand text and images and leverage its broad world knowledge to generate images with better instruction following and contextual awareness.

In constrast, we also offer specialized image generation models - DALL·E 2 and 3 - which don't have the same inherent understanding of the world as GPT Image.

You can learn more about image generation in our [Image generation](/docs/guides/image-generation) guide.

### Using world knowledge for image generation

The difference between DALL·E models and GPT Image is that a natively multimodal language model can use its visual understanding of the world to generate lifelike images including real-life details without a reference.

For example, if you prompt GPT Image to generate an image of a glass cabinet with the most popular semi-precious stones, the model knows enough to select gemstones like amethyst, rose quartz, jade, etc, and depict them in a realistic way.

Analyze images
--------------

**Vision** is the ability for a model to "see" and understand images. If there is text in an image, the model can also understand the text. It can understand most visual elements, including objects, shapes, colors, and textures, even if there are some [limitations](#limitations).

### Giving a model images as input

You can provide images as input to generation requests either by providing a fully qualified URL to an image file, or providing an image as a Base64-encoded data URL.

You can provide multiple images as input in a single request by including multiple images in the `content` array, but keep in mind that [images count as tokens](#calculating-costs) and will be billed accordingly.

Passing a URL

Analyze the content of an image

Passing a Base64 encoded image

Analyze the content of an image

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const imagePath = "path_to_your_image.jpg";
const base64Image = fs.readFileSync(imagePath, "base64");

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: [
                { type: "input_text", text: "what's in this image?" },
                {
                    type: "input_image",
                    image_url: `data:image/jpeg;base64,${base64Image}`,
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
import base64
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Function to encode the image
def encode_image(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode("utf-8")

# Path to your image
image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"

# Getting the Base64 string
base64_image = encode_image(image_path)

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                { "type": "input_text", "text": "what's in this image?" },
                {
                    "type": "input_image",
                    "image_url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}",
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
)

print(response.output_text)
```

### Image input requirements

Input images must meet the following requirements to be used in the API.

|Supported file types|PNG (.png)JPEG (.jpeg and .jpg)WEBP (.webp)Non-animated GIF (.gif)|
|Size limits|Up to 20MB per imageLow-resolution: 512px x 512pxHigh-resolution: 768px (short side) x 2000px (long side)|
|Other requirements|No watermarks or logosNo textNo NSFW contentClear enough for a human to understand|

### Specify image input detail level

The `detail` parameter tells the model what level of detail to use when processing and understanding the image (`low`, `high`, or `auto` to let the model decide). If you skip the parameter, the model will use `auto`.

```plain
{
    "type": "input_image",
    "image_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
    "detail": "high"
}
```

You can save tokens and speed up responses by using `"detail": "low"`. This lets the model process the image with a budget of 85 tokens. The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image. This is fine if your use case doesn't require the model to see with high-resolution detail (for example, if you're asking about the dominant shape or color in the image).

On the other hand, you can use `"detail": "high"` if you want the model to have a better understanding of the image.

Limitations
-----------

While models with vision capabilities are powerful and can be used in many situations, it's important to understand the limitations of these models. Here are some known limitations:

*   **Medical images**: The model is not suitable for interpreting specialized medical images like CT scans and shouldn't be used for medical advice.
*   **Non-English**: The model may not perform optimally when handling images with text of non-Latin alphabets, such as Japanese or Korean.
*   **Small text**: Enlarge text within the image to improve readability, but avoid cropping important details.
*   **Rotation**: The model may misinterpret rotated or upside-down text and images.
*   **Visual elements**: The model may struggle to understand graphs or text where colors or styles—like solid, dashed, or dotted lines—vary.
*   **Spatial reasoning**: The model struggles with tasks requiring precise spatial localization, such as identifying chess positions.
*   **Accuracy**: The model may generate incorrect descriptions or captions in certain scenarios.
*   **Image shape**: The model struggles with panoramic and fisheye images.
*   **Metadata and resizing**: The model doesn't process original file names or metadata, and images are resized before analysis, affecting their original dimensions.
*   **Counting**: The model may give approximate counts for objects in images.
*   **CAPTCHAS**: For safety reasons, our system blocks the submission of CAPTCHAs.

Calculating costs
-----------------

Image inputs are metered and charged in tokens, just as text inputs are. How images are converted to text token inputs varies based on the model. You can find a vision pricing calculator in the FAQ section of the [pricing page](https://openai.com/api/pricing/).

### GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-4.1-nano, o4-mini

Image inputs are metered and charged in tokens based on their dimensions. The token cost of an image is determined as follows:

*   Calculate the number of 32px x 32px patches that are needed to fully cover the image
*   If the number of patches exceeds 1536, we scale the image so that it can be covered by no more than 1536 patches.
*   The token cost is the number of patches, capped at a maximum of 1536 tokens
*   For `gpt-4.1-mini` we multiply image tokens by 1.62 to get total tokens, for `gpt-4.1-nano` we multiply image tokens by 2.46 to get total tokens, and for `o4-mini` we multiply image tokens by 1.72 to get total tokens, that are then billed at normal text token rates.

**Cost calculation examples**

*   A 1024 x 1024 image is **1024 tokens**
    *   Width is 1024, resulting in `(1024 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 32` patches
    *   Height is 1024, resulting in `(1024 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 32` patches
    *   Tokens calculated as `32 * 32 = 1024`, below the cap of 1536
*   A 1800 x 2400 image is **1452 tokens**
    *   Width is 1800, resulting in `(1800 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 57` patches
    *   Height is 2400, resulting in `(2400 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 75` patches
    *   We need `57 * 75 = 4275` patches to cover the full image. Since that exceeds 1536, we need to scale down the image while preserving the aspect ratio.
    *   We can calculate the shrink factor as `sqrt(token_budget × patch_size^2 / (width * height))`. In our example, the shrink factor is `sqrt(1536 * 32^2 / (1800 * 2400)) = 0.603`.
    *   Width is now 1086, resulting in `1086 / 32 = 33.94` patches
    *   Height is now 1448, resulting in `1448 / 32 = 45.25` patches
    *   We want to make sure the image fits in a whole number of patches. In this case we scale again by `33 / 33.94 = 0.97` to fit the width in 33 patches.
    *   The final width is then `1086 * (33 / 33.94) = 1056)` and the final height is `1448 * (33 / 33.94) = 1408`
    *   The image now requires `1056 / 32 = 33` patches to cover the width and `1408 / 32 = 44` patches to cover the height
    *   The total number of tokens is the `33 * 44 = 1452`, below the cap of 1536

### GPT 4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o-mini, CUA, and o-series (except o4-mini)

The token cost of an image is determined by two factors: size and detail.

Any image with `"detail": "low"` costs a set, base number of tokens. This amount varies by model (see charte below). To calculate the cost of an image with `"detail": "high"`, we do the following:

*   Scale to fit in a 2048px x 2048px square, maintaining original aspect ratio
*   Scale so that the image's shortest side is 768px long
*   Count the number of 512px squares in the image—each square costs a set amount of tokens (see chart below)
*   Add the base tokens to the total

|Model|Base tokens|Tile tokens|
|---|---|---|
|4o, 4.1, 4.5|85|170|
|4o-mini|2833|5667|
|o1, o1-pro, o3|75|150|
|computer-use-preview|65|129|

**Cost calculation examples (for gpt-4o)**

*   A 1024 x 1024 square image in `"detail": "high"` mode costs 765 tokens
    *   1024 is less than 2048, so there is no initial resize.
    *   The shortest side is 1024, so we scale the image down to 768 x 768.
    *   4 512px square tiles are needed to represent the image, so the final token cost is `170 * 4 + 85 = 765`.
*   A 2048 x 4096 image in `"detail": "high"` mode costs 1105 tokens
    *   We scale down the image to 1024 x 2048 to fit within the 2048 square.
    *   The shortest side is 1024, so we further scale down to 768 x 1536.
    *   6 512px tiles are needed, so the final token cost is `170 * 6 + 85 = 1105`.
*   A 4096 x 8192 image in `"detail": "low"` most costs 85 tokens
    *   Regardless of input size, low detail images are a fixed cost.

### GPT Image 1

For GPT Image 1, we calculate the cost of an image input the same way as described above, except that we scale down the image so that the shortest side is 512px instead of 768px. There is no detail level configuration for this model, so the price depends on the dimensions of the image.

The base cost is 65 image tokens, and each tile costs 129 image tokens.

To see pricing for image input tokens, refer to our [pricing page](/docs/pricing#latest-models).

We process images at the token level, so each image we process counts towards your tokens per minute (TPM) limit.
